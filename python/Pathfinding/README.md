# Pathfinding
Diverse experiments with some different pathfinding concepts that uses graphs.

There are different coding try's here. Some less then halfway done others more on the way.
Also there besides the code are two prepared images i use for experimental run's.

* Variant 1:(old)
  * Step 1. `maze_graph.py mask_image`
  * Step 2. `bfs.py graph_file.h5`

* Variant 2:
  * Step 1. `imgmask2graph.py mask_image`
  * Step 2. `path_search.py graph_file.h5`

* Variant 3:
  * Step 1. `maze2graph.py mask_image`
  * Step 2. `astar_search.py graph/graph.pickle`

_The code for the graph construction is influenced by the diskussion for a pathfinding mission on py.checkio.org some years ago and naturaly the excellent explainations on Amit Patel's site [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com)._
