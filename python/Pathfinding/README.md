# Pathfinding
Diverse experiments with some different pathfinding concepts and graphs

There are different coding try's here. Some less then halfway done others more on the way.
Also there besides the code are two prepared images i use for experimental runs.

* Variant 1(old):
  * Step 1. `maze_graph.py mask_image`
  * Step 2. `bfs.py graph_file.h5`

* Variant 2:
  * Step 1. `imgmask2graph.py mask_image`
  * Step 2. `path_search.py graph_file.h5`

* Variant 3:
  * Step 1. `imgmask2graph.py mask_image`
  * Step 2. `search_p.py graph/graph.pickle`
