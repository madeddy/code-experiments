# Pathfinding
Diverse experiments with some different pathfinding concepts and graphs. The code for graph constuction from image to an adjacency list and the pathfinding are splited in different files.

Besides the code there are two prepared images i use for experimental run's.

* Variant 3:
  * Step 1. `maze2graph.py mask_image`
  * Step 2. `astar_search.py graph/graph.pickle`
  The current solution. Works clean and fast.

TODO: Add a clean Breadth First Search. Look into heuristics (again...).

---
_The code for the graph construction is influenced by the diskussion for a pathfinding mission on py.checkio.org some years ago and naturaly the excellent explainations on Amit Patel's site [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com)._
