# Convert to Webp
C2W is a app for converting image files of the most common formats to webp. To choose between lossless and lossy is possible.

A list of supported formats are in the doc's of "Pillow" to find. It's extensive.

`Webp` is also to count because it can be reconverted in a different(lower) quality setting or another image format.


    Note: Converting of animated gif images is still somewhat unstable because the oder encoder versions are bugged.
    Images come possible with to slow playback out of it.
